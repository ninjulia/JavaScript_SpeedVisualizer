Intent: This code example was designed to show customers the differences in internet speeds, showcasing how much faster the cable company was in comparison to services offered by their competitors. The fully responsive module could be plugged into their CMS and featured within their shopping pages as a sales tool. JQuery was leveraged to approximate the time it would take to download common file types, including music files, games, movies, and photos.
