# Internet Download Speed Visualizer

This code example was developed for a regional cable and internet provider who wanted to educate their customers on the differences between the various internet service speeds on offer. The fully responsive module plugged into their existing CMS and featured within their shopping pages as a sales tool. JQuery was leveraged to approximate the time it would take to download common file types, including music files, games, movies, and photos.

## Overview

### The brief

#### Purpose:

Customers often don't understand the capabilities of different internet speed levels. Customers need to have the differences illustrated for them so they can make a more informed purchase.

#### Users should be able to:

- View the available internet speeds
- Compare the expected download speeds of various internet files
- Be able to click on an internet speed to proceed to purchase

#### Business Decisions

- Visualizer must fit within existing page template areas
- Display internet speeds in descending order
- Direct attention to the fastest internet speed
